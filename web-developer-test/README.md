# Challenges
Originally I wanted to make the application a lot more dynamic than the static search feature I currently have implemented. So I originally started with more dynamic features allowing the user to search any pokemon and it would return back as a filtered list. However I learned that this would become more difficult because the way I was returning data was mainly via the name, whereas for further development I wanted to return further detail for each pokemon which with the current model I developed would be very difficult to implement.

# If I had more time, what would I implement?
I understand that I spent a lot of time trying to work on the main feature of the task, so I would like to further improve the UX of the project, implement a favourites system and the filter via generation as originally asked. However I'd like to also potentially add in a feature where you can filter via the games that each pokemon starred in.
